# How to ask for help:

You have:

* [ ] ‘[rubber duck debugged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)’ your own question.
* [ ] checked that this question hasn’t been asked before.
* [ ] noted in your message what you’ve tried.
* [ ] avoided the ‘[XY problem](https://xyproblem.info/)’ by clearly detailing the core problem, X.
* [ ] provided specifics of your issue, not vague references or descriptions.
* [ ] provided URL links to relevant content, and where possible the URL links are immutable.
* [ ] **not** included screenshots of text in your message. (screenshots are not searchable)
* [ ] not used obscure acronyms or abbreviations.
* [ ] formatted my message well, particularly paying attention to code formatting and headings.
* [ ] not just said “hi” and waited for a reply.
